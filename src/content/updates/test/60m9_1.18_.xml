 9.4 Liability for damages will be limited and excluded as set forth above even if any exclusive remedy provided in this  Agreement fails of its essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

 10 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. 
The Technology is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), and may consist of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. � 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Technology with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this Agreement.

 11 GENERAL.
 11.1 All disputes will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  The venue for litigation will be the appropriate courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
 11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
 11.3 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under this Agreement will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation on non-enforcement.  To be enforceable, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

 11.1 All disputes will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  The venue for litigation will be the appropriate courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
 11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction.
