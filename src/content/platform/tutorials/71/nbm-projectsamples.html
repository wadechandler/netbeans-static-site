        <h1>NetBeans Project Sample Module Tutorial</h1>

        <p>This tutorial demonstrates how to create a module that adds a sample
            to the New Project wizard. The sample could function either as an example
            to the user or as a new project template that provides the basic files needed to
            get started working on a technology of some kind.</p>

        <h2><a name="intro"></a>Introduction to Project Samples</h2>

        <p>Using two wizards in the IDE&#8212;the New Module Project wizard and the
            New Project Template wizard&#8212;you can very easily create a module that
            contains your technology's project samples. No coding of any kind is needed in
            order to do this. The wizards do all the work for you. In fact, if you find yourself
            doing any coding at all, you are possibly doing something wrong. Coding should only
            be necessary in a small set of corner cases.</p>
        <p>When you complete this tutorial, you will have a module that contains
            your samples. The intended users of your samples
            can then simply use the Plugin Manager to install the module. As a result, the samples
            will appear in the New Project wizard.</p>

        <p>At the end of this tutorial, the New Project wizard will contain a new sample,
            called "My Sample Application":</p>

                    <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-4.png" alt="changing the description"/></p></li>

        <p>In addition to showing how to create a module containing a sample,
            you will be instructed on some ancillary topics, such as how to change
            the icon and description in the New Project wizard, and how to regenerate
            the sample after modifying its sources.</p>

        <h2 class="tutorial"><a name="creatingthemoduleproject"></a>Creating the Module Project</h2>

        <p>We begin by working through the New Module Project
            wizard. At the end of it, we will have a basic
            source structure, with some default files, that
            every NetBeans module requires.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl+Shift+N). Under Categories, select NetBeans Modules.
                Under Projects, select Module. Click Next.</li>
            <li>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>AdditionalSamples</tt> in the Project Name field.
                Change the Project Location to any directory on your computer. Click Next.</li>
            <li>In the Basic Module Configuration panel, type <tt>org.myorg.additionalsamples</tt>
                in Code Name Base. Click Finish.</li>
        </ol>

        <p> The IDE creates the <tt>AdditionalSamples</tt>
            project. The project contains all of your sources and
            project metadata, such as the project's Ant build script. The project
            opens in the IDE. You can view its logical structure in the Projects window (Ctrl-1) and its
            file structure in the Files window (Ctrl-2).</p>

        <!-- ===================================================================================== -->
        <h2><a name="creatingandgettingtoknowthemainfiles"></a>Bundling the Sample Application</h2>
        <p>Now that we have a module project, which gives us our source structure,
            we simply run through another wizard that will bundle our sample. You simply
            need to select it in the wizard and then the wizard will
            generate all the required classes and registration
            details for you.</p>


        <ol>

            <li>Right-click the project node and 
                choose New &gt; Other. Under Categories, select NetBeans Module Development. Under Projects, 
                select Project Template. Click Next.</li>
            <li><p>In the Select Project panel, select the project
                    that you want to bundle as a sample, as shown below.</p>

                    <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-5.png" alt="changing the description"/></p></li>

                <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> Only projects that
                    are open in the IDE are shown in
                    the Project drop-down above. To bundle
                    an external project as a sample, use the
                    Browse button to locate it in your
                    filesystem.</p>

                <p>Click Next.</p></li>

            <li><p>In the Name and Location panel, type <tt>MySampleApplication</tt> as the template name,
                    type <tt>My Sample Application</tt> as the display name,
                    and select Samples | Java in the Category drop-down, as 
                    shown below:</p>

                <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-1.png" alt="Name and location panel."/></p></li>

            <li>Click Finish.</li></ol>

        <p> The IDE creates the following:</p>
        <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-2.png" alt="Name and location panel."/></p></li>

        <ul><li><tt>MySampleApplicationProject.zip.</tt> A ZIP file containing your sample.</li>
            <li><tt>MySampleApplicationDescription.html.</tt> An HTML file for the description
                displayed in the New Project wizard's description field.</li>
            <li><tt>MySampleApplicationPanelVisual.</tt>
                <br><tt>MySampleApplicationWizardIterator.java.</tt>
                <br><tt>MySampleApplicationWizardPanel.java.</tt></br>
                A <tt>JPanel</tt>, with a supporting wizard class, and an iterator
                used in the New Project wizard to create the sample. You do not need
                to understand how these work, unless you want to. Later in this tutorial,
                these classes are discussed, although they are not necessary to understand
                in most scenarios involving the creation of project samples.</li>
        </ul>


        <!-- ======================================================================================= -->

        <h2><a name="building"></a>Building and Installing the Module</h2>
        <p>The IDE uses an Ant build script to build and install your module. The build script is created for you
            when you create the module project.</p>
        <div class="indent">

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="installing-the-nbm"></a>Installing the NetBeans Module</h3>

            <p>In the Projects window, right-click the <tt>AdditionalSamples</tt> project and choose Install/Reload
                in Target Platform.</p>
            <p>The module is built and installed in the target IDE or Platform. The target IDE or Platform opens so that you
                can try out your new module. The default target IDE or Platform is the 
                installation used by the current instance of the development IDE. </p>
            <p><b class="notes">Note:</b> When you run your module, you will be using 
                a temporary test user directory, not the development IDE's user directory.</p> 

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="using-the-nbm"></a>Using the NetBeans Module</h3>

            <p>In this section, we take on the role of the user of our sample. After a user
                installs our module, they typically take the steps outlined below.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><p>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). The New Project wizard opens and displays
                        the new project sample:</p>
                    <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-4.png" alt="changing the description"/></p></li>
                <li><p>Select the new project sample and click Next. 
                    Type a name in the project name field. Click Finish.
                    The Projects window opens and
                        displays the newly created project sample.</p></li>
            </ol>
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="creating-the-nbm"></a>Creating a Shareable Module Binary</h3>

            <p>To make our sample available to our users, we need to create an NBM file, which
                is a binary NetBeans module file, containing our sample.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>In the Projects window, right-click the <tt>AdditionalSamples</tt> 
                    project and choose Create NBM. The NBM file is created
                    and you can view it in the Files window (Ctrl-2):</p>
                    <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-7.png" alt="changing the description"/></p></li>
                <li>Make it available to others via, for example, e-mail. Or create your own NetBeans
                    Update Center and publish it there. Or publish it in the <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/">NetBeans Plugin Portal</a>.</li>
            </ol>

        </div>

        <!-- ======================================================================================= -->

        <h2><a name="tweaking"></a>Tweaking the Sample</h2>

        <p>In this section, we perform some typical tasks
            that you might want to perform after completing
            the New Project Template wizard, in order to finetune
            your sample. For example, you might want to change the
            sample's icon, description, and similar items.</p>
        <div class="indent">
            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="icon"></a>Changing the Icon</h3>
            <p>Optionally, you can change the icon you chose when
                 you worked through the New Project Template wizard.</p>
            <p>
               Within the annotation at the top of the iterator class,
               the <tt>iconBase</tt> attribute reflects your icon choice:</p>
<pre class=examplecode>@TemplateRegistration(
        folder = "Project/Samples/Standard", 
        displayName = "#MySampleApplication_displayName", 
        description = "MySampleApplicationDescription.html", 
        <b>iconBase = "org/myorg/additionalsamples/MySampleApplication.png",</b> 
        content = "MySampleApplicationProject.zip")</pre>          

                    <p>Manually change the icon, by adding it to your module,
                        and changing its name and location in the annotation
                        shown above.</p>

            </p>


            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="category"></a>Changing the Category</h3>
            <p>When we used the New Project Template wizard, we assigned the
                sample to a category. Afterwards, we can put it in a different category,
                using the <tt>folder</tt> attribute to do so:</p>
            <p>
               Within the annotation at the top of the iterator class,
               the <tt>iconBase</tt> attribute reflects your icon choice:</p>
<pre class=examplecode>@TemplateRegistration(
        <b>folder = "Project/Samples/Standard"</b>, 
        displayName = "#MySampleApplication_displayName", 
        description = "MySampleApplicationDescription.html", 
        iconBase = "org/myorg/additionalsamples/MySampleApplication.png",
        content = "MySampleApplicationProject.zip")</pre>          

            </p>


            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="description"></a>Changing the Description</h3>
            <p>Next, we can change the sample's description, which is shown
                in the New Project wizard. As with the icon, a default
                description is provided when you create a module containing
                a sample. However, you can easily change that description.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Open the file shown below and notice the default text shown in the editor:</p>
                    <p><img alt="" src="../../images/tutorials/mysample/71/proj-temp-3.png" alt="changing the description"/></p></li>
                <li>Change the text, reinstall the module, and notice the changed
                    description in the New Project wizard.</li>
            </ol>


            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="description"></a>Adding a Panel</h3>
            <p>In the previous section, we changed the iterator,
                which resulted in a different panel being shown. Possibly,
                however, there is no existing iterator to cater to your
                specific needs. In this section, we learn how to
                add a new panel to the wizard. We do this by reusing the
                iterator that the New Project Template wizard creates
                for us.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Use the Wizard wizard to create a new wizard panel
                    which, just like the panel created by the New Project Template
                    wizard, consists of a <tt>JPanel</tt> and a wizard class.</li>
                <li>Instantiate the new wizard panel in the iterator's 
                    <tt>createPanels()</tt> method, as shown here:

                    <pre class=examplecode>private WizardDescriptor.Panel[] createPanels() {
    return new WizardDescriptor.Panel[] {
        <b>//This is the wizard panel, created by the
        //New Project Template wizard:</b>
        new MySampleApplicationWizardPanel()
        <b>//This is the new wizard panel, created by the
        //New Wizard wizard:</b>
        //new MySampleApplicationWizardPanel1()
    };
}</pre>

                    <p>You only need to add your new wizard panel to the method
                        above, and then it will be instantiated when the
                        sample's wizard is invoked by the user in the New
                        Project wizard.</p></li>

                <li>Finally, you need to add a new string
                    to the iterator's <tt>createSteps()</tt> method,
                    so that your new wizard panel is accompanied
                    by a string in the left sidebar of the wizard:

                    <pre class=examplecode>private String[] createSteps() {
    return new String[] {
        NbBundle.getMessage(MySampleApplicationWizardIterator.class, "LBL_CreateProjectStep"),
        <b>NbBundle.getMessage(MySampleApplicationWizardIterator.class, "LBL_CreateProjectStep1")</b>
    };
}</pre> 

                    <p>You only need to add the line in bold above, and then
                        define the key/value pair in the <tt>Bundle.properties</tt> file.</p></li>

            </ol>

            <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="sources"></a>Updating the Sources</h3>
            <p>When you change the sample's sources, how do you update the module
                that bundles the sample? Do you need to recreate the module project, work
                through the New Project Template wizard again, and then recreate the NBM file?
                No. The only part of the sample module project that is impacted by changes
                in the original sample's sources is the ZIP file. The ZIP file contains the sources,
                and those are the only pieces that are affected when you make changes to the
                original project. Hence, you simply need to recreate the ZIP file. To simplify this,
                if you add the following Ant target to the <tt>build.xml</tt> file of
                the project where you created the sources, you can regenerate the ZIP file from inside the IDE
