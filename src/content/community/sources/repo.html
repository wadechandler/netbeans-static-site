            <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is the tool you use to access the NetBeans sources here on netbeans.org, either from
            the command line, or even using the Git support built into the IDE itself!
            Before you start you should know how the sources are organized, both in terms
            of directory <a href="../../community/sources/structure.html">structure</a>.
            You can
            <a href="http://hg.netbeans.org/">browse the Mercurial repositories</a> online
            to get an overview of available repositories. 
            For more general information, read the book <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git</a>.

            The software developed at netbeans.org may make use of third-party

        <h2>Getting the Sources</h2>

        <p>These guides show you how to get anonymous access to the NetBeans.org Mercurial repository.
            If you do not have Git installed, first
            <a href="https://git-scm.com/">download</a>
            and install one of the available ports for your operating system.
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Using NetBeans</b> <i>(Recommended)</i> &mdash; You can use the NetBeans IDE
                itself to get the sources. This method is the same for every operating system.
                Read: <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/HgNetBeansSources">Using 
                    Mercurial to work with NetBeans Sources in the IDE</a>
            <li> <b>From the command line</b> run the following command to get the repository.
                <pre class="examplecode">$ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-netbeans.git</pre>
    </ul>

    <h2>Authenticated Push Access</h2>
    <p>
    Using the anonymous login, you can clone, edit and use the sources on your computer.
    To contribute your changes to the NetBeans repository
    without submitting patches and relying on other people to commit them,
    you will need a free named account with push (write) privileges.
    The only difference from the anonymous access is
    that you enter your username and a non-blank password.
    If you think you should have a push account,
    please see <a href="../contribute/hg.html">Getting Mercurial Push Access</a>.</p>
