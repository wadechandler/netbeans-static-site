        <p>The NetBeans source code is available under the
            <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/">Apache Software License</a>.
            The source code is available in a Git repository. All
            development of NetBeans happens using the Git server on this site,
            and development proposals and decisions happen on the
            <a href="../lists/index.html">public mailing lists</a>.
        </p>
        <p>You can get to the sources in several ways.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Through Git - see the <a href="repo.html">Git Overview page</a> for
                details;</li>
            <li>Download an archived snapshot (ZIP) from the <a
                    href="../../downloads/index.html">downloads page</a>;</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>So what exactly is here?</h2>

        <p>What is available here is the entire source tree and history of
            the NetBeans IDE. Generally, there is a "stable" branch and a
            "development branch." The development
            branch is where ongoing development happens - it will be more or less
            stable depending on what point
            in the release cycle it is.</p>

        <p>For a a description of the physical organization
            of the sources in the Mercurial repository, see <a href="structure.html">Mercurial
                Repositories</a>.</p>
