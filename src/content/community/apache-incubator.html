        <p class="disc">Leading up to the premier Java conference, JavaOne 2016, Oracle has 
            proposed contributing the NetBeans IDE as a new open-source project 
            within the Apache Incubator, called Apache NetBeans (incubating). 
            The <a href="https://wiki.apache.org/incubator/NetBeansProposal">proposed project</a> will open up the governance model of NetBeans.  
            As part of the proposal, Oracle has reaffirmed its commitment to NetBeans as 
            it transitions to an Apache project going forward.</p>

        <p class="disc">NetBeans IDE is an integrated development environment available for Windows, Mac, 
            Linux, and Solaris. It enables developers to rapidly create Web, enterprise, 
            desktop and mobile applications primarily for the Java and HTML5 platforms, 
            as well as for PHP and C/C++, together with other languages and technologies 
            provided by plugins and add-ons. The combination of technologies, ease of use, 
            and “out-of-the-box” experience is widely recognized as making NetBeans IDE unique. </p>

        <p>NetBeans IDE has approximately 1.5 million active users worldwide. It is a well-established
            learning platform and teaching framework that is broadly used in the educational sector
            within universities, colleges, and schools. It is also a widely used development productivity
            environment, tooling platform and application framework, supporting a range of languages
            and technologies, as well as being the basis of mission-critical scientific software
            at organizations such as NASA, NATO, Airbus and Boeing.</p>

        <p>
            The role of open source technologies has evolved tremendously in the 18 years since 
            the NetBeans Governance model was first established and Oracle wants to ensure that 
            the project continues its success going forward. In order to support that success, 
            Oracle is relinquishing 
            its control of NetBeans and introducing it to Apache's widely accepted governance model, 
            which will provide new opportunities to the NetBeans community and stimulate further 
            code contributions. </p>

        <p>By bringing NetBeans to the Apache family, Oracle is opening up the NetBeans 
            governance model to give NetBeans constituents a greater voice in the project's 
            direction and future success through the upcoming release of Java 9 and NetBeans 9 
            and beyond. Evolution within the Apache ecosystem will simplify and streamline 
            the process of contributing code to NetBeans. It will also encourage participation 
            in the continued growth of the communities benefiting from the versatility and stability 
            that NetBeans provides.</p>
