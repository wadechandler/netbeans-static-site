<p>As we approach <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/articles/javaone/2011/index.html"
 target="newwindow">JavaOne
2011</a>, let's take a look at where the best tips, tricks, and
articles about the NetBeans IDE and NetBeans Platform are coming from.
More often than not, these are written by the worldwide NetBeans
blogger community.</p>
<p><a href="http://planetnetbeans.org/" target="newwindow">
PlanetNetBeans.org</a>
is the
aggregator of all NetBeans-related blogs, helping bloggers from all
around the world link their blogs in a centralized location. Blog
entries on PlanetNetBeans.org are automatically displayed in the
NetBeans IDE Welcome Screen. A recent <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/polls/" target="newwindow">NetBeans
community
poll</a>
showed that a high percentage of NetBeans users get the latest NetBeans
news from the Welcome Screen; this makes PlanetNetBeans a good place to
be if as a blogger you want to reach out to the NetBeans community.</p>
<p>Popular blogs aggregated on PlanetNetBeans.org include several by
NetBeans Dream Team members, who are the NetBeans official thought
leaders in the wider open source community. For example, <a
 href="http://javaevangelist.blogspot.com" target="newwindow">John Yeary</a>,
president
of
the
Greenville
JUG, blogs a lot about JSF and the support that NetBeans
has for this leading web application framework. The samples he
discusses in his blog are also often made available as NetBeans
projects, so check out this blog if you're a Java EE developer.</p>
<p>Similarly, NetBeans Dream Team member <a
 href="http://www.adam-bien.com/roller/abien/" target="newwindow">Adam
Bien</a> provides a
lot of up to date information about NetBeans in the Java EE world. "On
every save NetBeans deploys your application behind the scenes in
milliseconds," he writes in a recent blog, explaining how incremental
builds work and how to set them up in the IDE. <a
 href="http://netbeanside61.blogspot.com" target="newwindow">Tushar
Joshi</a>, another
NetBeans Dream Team member, this time from India, often provides useful
info about the general features of NetBeans IDE, such as how to change
from package to hierarchical views in the NetBeans Projects window.
Other frequent NetBeans bloggers from the NetBeans Dream Team include <a
 href="http://eppleton.de/blog" target="newwindow">Anton Epple</a> and <a
 href="http://www.aljoscha-rittner.de/blog" target="newwindow">Aljoscha
Rittner</a> from
the German community.</p>
<p>The NetBeans Team itself also sports several
active blogs. Most
significant of these is the <a
 href="http://blogs.oracle.com/netbeansphp" target="newwindow">NetBeans
PHP Team blog</a>.
The NetBeans PHP IDE has become very popular in a very short space of
time, which can at least partly be explained by its enthusiastic
development team. The team communicates directly with its users via the
NetBeans PHP blog, where new features are announced and discussed with
users. For example, recently Smarty framework support was announced by
the NetBeans PHP Team in their blog, which received enthusiastic
responses from the blog followers, as well as follow up questions about
the status of Twig in the IDE.</p>
<p>Let's also not forget the blog by
NetBeans architect <a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org"
 target="newwindow">Jaroslav Tulach</a>,
filled with
idiosyncratic pointers useful for API designers everywhere. Other
popular blogs from the NetBeans Team include those by <a
 href="http://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan" target="newwindow">Geertjan
Wielenga</a> and <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/rechtacek"
 target="newwindow">Jiri Rechtacek</a>. Both
these blogs have existed for several years and provide a wide range of
wisdom and insight into the internals of the NetBeans project.</p>
<p>Aside
from the NetBeans Dream Team and the NetBeans Team itself,
there are many more blogs that are worthy of mention. For example,
blogs by <a href="http://layerxml.wordpress.com" target="newwindow">Nicklas
Lof</a> in
Sweden, <a href="http://tim-sparg.blogspot.com/search/label/NetBeans"
 target="newwindow">Tim
Sparg</a> in South Africa, and <a
 href="http://praxisintermedia.wordpress.com" target="newwindow">Neil
C. Smith</a> in the
UK, all providing tips, tricks, and insights that you'll not find
anywhere else.</p>
<p>Indeed, the blogging community around NetBeans is an
important
aspect of NetBeans support for developers everywhere. Let's take this
moment to thank everyone for all the hard work they've done over the
past years!</p>
