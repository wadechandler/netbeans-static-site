				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1223">Introducing NUG Indonesia aka NECTAR</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						There's a new NetBeans Users Group in the NetBeans community: NUG Indonesia! Read about the group's growth from a one-person mailing list to a 289-member (and counting!) code-sharing force.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1221">Add "Tip of the Day" Feature to a Platform Application!</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						You may think your NetBeans Platform application is complete, but... is it really? Maybe it isn't... does it have a 'Tip of the Day' feature, so that your users will see a new tip every time they start up your application? Geertjan discusses (and, in the comments, provides a link to the complete sample) a module that provides 'Tip of the Day' functionality. The tips are loaded from the NetBeans user directory, which means that you can send new tips to your users, simply by distributing a new tip file to them. Or the user might want to change the tips themselves. That's possible too.</p>

						Get the latest version (9.3) of jMaki then check out this mini-tutorial on how to use jMaki in a NetBeans Visual Web Pack project. With jMaki, you can more easily use widgets from libraries such as Dojo and Yahoo in your JavaServer Faces applications.</p><br style="clear:both;"/>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1220">Why Model With UML?</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						This article serves as a primer for the basic concepts of UML while providing an understanding of the purposes of modeling. It is written for those engineers who can never find time to model a project before starting to code and for those engineers who have not yet considered creating models of their systems prior to coding them. It presents some methods and strategies to help you be more efficient and possibly even save time.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1226">Seam Refresh</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						It's been over a year since Brian first wrote about Seam and enough has changed over that time to deserve a refresh of the entry. Seam is now at  version 1.2.1 and JBoss just recently released version 4.2. The entry shows you how to set everything up using the latest releases of both, as well as on running Seam on GlassFish.</p>

				<h2><a href="http://services.netbeans.org/newsletter/story.php?id=1227">Optimizing the Building of Large NetBeans RCP Projects</a></h2>
						<p style="margin-left:8px;">
						From Dream Team member Fabrizio Giudici: "If you are developing a large project with NetBeans RCP, sooner or later compiling will take a lot of time. For the sake of the project, it's important to address this efficiency issue in the build process. If you don't see code reorganization as merely "moving files around" but as the consequence of a design/architecture refactoring, you'll get some extra benefits."</p>
