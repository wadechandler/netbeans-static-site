Brazil Plugs Into NetBeans
The NetBeans team has been busy in Brazil. In November alone, we participated in
the Maratona 4 Java and the Sou+Java Symposium, embarked on a nine city training
tour, and launched an exciting, new initiative that focuses on NetBeans plug-in
development entitled Desafio NetBeans. Find out more in this article from Ruth
Kusterer and Robert Demmer.

Hibernate Plug-in for NetBeans 5.0
Via Petr Blaha's weblog: Many developers don't like EJB, JDO technologies and
they are using other object/relational persistance and query service for Java
like Hibernate. Hibernate lets you develop persistant classes following common
Java idiom. The plug-in for Hibernate in NetBeans was missing until recently.

Adding Libraries While Creating Applications
When creating a web application, you probably know which libraries you're going to
need. Taking the extra step of using the Library Manager is a waste of your time.
If you read this blog entry in Geertjan's blog, you'll find out how to create a
very simple NetBeans module that enables you to select your libraries from the New
Web Application wizard:

NetBeans Graph Library
Recently made available as a public API, the NetBeans Graph library supports
visual modelling of source code elements - or any kind of diagrammable model.
While originally developed as part of the Mobility Pack, it is general purpose
enough to use in any Swing application.

Meet NetBeans Module Writer Sandip Chitale
A week or two ago, James Gosling attended a demonstration that blew him away. The
smoothness of module development in NetBeans IDE 5.0 really surprised him. Meet
the man behind that demonstration: Sandip Chitale, Senior Staff Engineer for Sun
Java Studio Creator. In this interview, Sandip shares his opinions openly and
discusses some of the modules he's been working on. Plus, you get to download them
and try them out yourself!

Swing Dominates New Rich Client Development
The "Swing Dominates New Clientside Development" entry is about NetBeans RCP +

Collaboration Module Quickstart
Talk code with the other developers live over the network, be it in your local
team or on another continent. NetBeans Developer Collaboration lets you chat and
share code while keeping syntax coloring, project file structure and formatting
intact.

You Too Can Extend the Component Palette
Even if you never thought of developing modules before, it's a good idea to give
it a go anyway, especially if you're a web developer. In NetBeans IDE 5.0, web
developers have a component palette with code snippets (chunks of JSP and HTML
tags) that they can drag into their JSP file or HTML file. However, it's very
easy to create modules that add additional code snippets to the Component Palette
and to then share the snippets with other developers -- just create a quick
NetBeans module containing your code snippets, generate an NBM file, and then
distribute the NBM file to whoever needs it. For details, see Geertjan's blog:
